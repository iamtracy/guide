                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Each computer that is logging in to the XPOCAST Presenter Portal as either speaker or support staffer should meet the following requirements to ensure proper connectivity to the XPOCAST system.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Have a Hard Wired Internet Connection: </b>Turn off wireless access on the computer to ensure the computer is using the hardwired connection.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Pass the System Check: </b>Speakers must pass on each item in the system check to properly present: https://vts.inxpo.com/Launch/Event.htm?</p>

                <h4>Network Requirements:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>When giving a webcast, particularly a video webcast, it is important to ensure the speaker’s network is able to handle streaming to the internet and will not impede the delivery or cause an issue for the speaker and/or the audience.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Speakers should confirm that their presentation location has enough available bandwidth for an XPOCAST presentation in advance of the dry run. A minimum of 600 KBPS “up” is recommended for delivering a presentation.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To calculate available bandwidth:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to the speed test and start the test (select Chicago)</li>
                    <li>Take the “Upload Speed” result (given in MBPS)</li>
                    <li>Access a MBPS to KBPS converter (i.e. Check Your Math) and enter your MBPS number and convert to KBPS</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In addition users should pass on each of the Port Tests.</p>

                <h4>Tips and Tricks For Delivery:</h4>
                <p>When planning to present using XPOCAST it is recommended that each speaker:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Test their system as soon as they sign on to speak</li>
                    <li>Determine their delivery location and test the network at least 48 hours before the dry run</li>
                    <li>Participate in a dry run of the webcast to ensure connectivity with their engineer</li>
                    <li>Always use the same location/equipment used for testing on the live day</li>
                </ul>
